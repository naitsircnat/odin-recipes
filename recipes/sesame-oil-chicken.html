    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The most aromatic and delicious braised chicken ever, with loads of sesame oil and ginger. A homey dinner in 20 mins.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>1 chicken, chopped into bite-sized pieces (skin on)</li>
       <li>1 piece ginger, about the size of your thumb, sliced</li> 
       <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li> 
       <li>1/2 cup (120ml) sesame oil</li> 
       <li>2 tablespoons light soy</li> 
       <li>2 tablespoons dark soy (more if you prefer the sauce to be darker)</li> 
       <li>2 cups (480ml) water</li> 
       <li>1/4 tsp white pepper, grounded</li>  
    </ul>
    <h4>To marinate chicken</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light soy</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper, grounded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by marinating the chicken. While I believe that at most times, marinating the chicken for an hour or so improves its flavour, it really is a step that you can omit here if you do not have the time. I really do not think it makes that much difference to the end result in this case.</li>
        <li>In a heated wok, add sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Once the oil was hot, add the ginger and garlic. The oil will start bubbling. Fry the ginger and garlic for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken all at once. Stir to combine and added the soy sauces and the pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the water. You can either place everything into a slow cooker and cook on AUTO for about 4-6 hours, or continue cooking in the wok (stirring occasionally) with a lid on for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with rice</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>If you do not marinate the chicken, then add the marinating ingredients to the sauce.</p>
